As a teacher, it was a pleasure for me to lecture in your class. I don‚Äôt remember even a single occassion I was forced to scold at you. You were so loving, cool, sincere and dedicated.  It is upsetting to miss the last few weeks in your college life. But, I am sure you have compensatd it to some extent with the help of technology. I want to thank you for all the warmth memories and learning that we had together. I too learned many things from you.
